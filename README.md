## Installation Processes
For this program there is no installation process needed. Running the program will suffice.

## App Usage
The application is easy to use. Open the terminal under the "index.js" file, and run the command "node index" in the terminal to start the program. From there, a series of questions will be asked related to the creation of the SVG logo. Answer each question and once finished a file called output.svg will be created. Open the file in your browser to see your generated logo! <br>
